# In development

This project was started on 23/03/2024 and is currently being worked on. It will be similar to the mobile app at https://github.com/adammarszalek22/pl but I'm hoping to improve the UI and add more features in the server as I go along (https://github.com/adammarszalek22/pl-server).

For now the HTML and CSS files are a simple design as I'm focusing on functionality first.

# TODOS - done

- Setup the main structure of the webserver - done
- Decide where and how to store access token (server or localStorage) - done (storing it with sessionId on the server)
- Create and test login and registration functionality as well as page routing once login is successful - done

# TODOS

- Add documentation to each api call function that communicates with the python pl server (params and what it returns)

- Currently the UI for login and registration was copied from another source, will implement at the very end to match the UI of the whole website
