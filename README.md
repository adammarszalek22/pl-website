# In development

This project was started on 23/03/2024 and is currently being worked on. It will be similar to the mobile app at https://github.com/adammarszalek22/pl but I'm hoping to improve the UI and add more features in the server as I go along (https://github.com/adammarszalek22/pl-server).

For now the HTML and CSS files are a simple design as I'm focusing on functionality first.

# TODOS

- Setup the main structure of the webserver
- Create and test login and registration functionality as well as page routing once login is successful
- Add documentation to each api call function that communicates with the python pl server (params and what it returns)
